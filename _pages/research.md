I'm currently a research assistant at the [Ã–lveczky Lab](https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/), where I'm building a platform to train embodied animals agents on realistic tasks so they can be better compared to their biological counterparts. 

My research interests are generally in biologically inspired AI and NeuroAI. AI is cool, and understanding the brain is even cooler!

I got my start in AI research as a part of the [BINDS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/), exploring continual learning, multi-task learning, and modularity in neural networks. 

In my final year of undergrad, I worked on an interdisciplinary project to apply neural networks for better hydrological analysis. I hope to continue to apply my knowledge and skills to environmental/climate work in the future. 

For a grad-level course, I worked on a semester-long project on learning out-of-distribution generalization of relational concepts. Got some interesting results but work has been put on hold for now.
