My research interests are generally in biologically inspired AI and NeuroAI. AI is cool, and understanding the brain might be even cooler!

I got my start in AI research as a part of the [BINDS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/), exploring continual learning, multi-task learning, and modularity in neural networks. 

In my final year of undergrad, I worked on [an interdisciplinary project](https://esto.nasa.gov/project-selections-for-aist-21/#Gleason) to apply neural networks for better hydrological analysisâ€”I hope to continue to apply my knowledge and skills to environmental/climate work in the future. 

For a grad-level course, I worked on a semester-long project on learning out-of-distribution generalization of relational concepts. I'm planning on continuing this work and perhaps get it published!
