My research interests are generally in biologically inspired AI and NeuroAI. Good AI is awesome, and understanding the brain and mind might be even better!

I got my start in AI research as a part of the [BINDS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/) working independently on continual learning, multi-task learning, and modularity in neural networks. 

Currently, I'm working on a [grant](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/geoscientist-awarded-21m-grant-create-global-open-source-software-system-tracking) to apply neural networks for better hydrological analysisâ€”I hope to continue to apply my knowledge to environmental work in the future. 

I'm also working on a project on learning out-of-distribution generalization of concepts in different modalities.

Contact me if you have any opportunities I might find interesting :)
