My research interests are generally in biologically inspired AI and NeuroAI. Good AI is awesome, and understanding the brain and mind might be even better!

I got my start in AI research as a part of the [BINDS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/) working independently on continual learning, multi-task learning, and modularity in neural networks. 

In my final year of undergrad, I worked on an interdisciplinary project to apply neural networks for better hydrological analysisâ€”I hope to continue to apply my knowledge an skills to environmental work in the future. 

For the course CS591NR, I worked on a semester-long project on learning out-of-distribution generalization of relational concepts. I'm planning on continuing this work and perhaps get it published!
