# About my research

My research interests are generally in AI and NeuroAI. AI is cool, and understanding the brain is even cooler! I'm currently a post-bacc researcher at the [Ã–lveczky Lab](https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/), where I'm building a platform to model biomechanistically realistic animal agents in a physical environment using deep reinforcement learning.

## My research journey

I got my start in AI research as a part of the [BINDS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/), exploring continual learning, multi-task learning, and modularity in neural networks. 

In my senior year of undergrad, I worked on an interdisciplinary project to apply neural networks for better hydrological analysis. I hope to continue to apply my knowledge and skills to environmental/climate work in the future. 

For a grad-level course, I worked on a semester-long project on learning out-of-distribution generalization of relational concepts. I'm hoping to explore this line of work further at some point.
