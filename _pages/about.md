title: About me
---

I graduated from UMass Amherst with a major in Computer Science and a minor in philosophy. Currently a SWE intern at Amazon. Generally interested in anything related to the cognitive sciences. I like staying active, love sleeping a full 8 hours, and binge-watching rock climbing youtube videos in my free time :)
