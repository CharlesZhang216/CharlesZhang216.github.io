title: About me
---

I graduated from UMass Amherst in Spring 2023 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in philosophy, and I'm now a fulltime research assistant at the [Ã–lveczky Lab](https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. Generally interested in anything related to the cognitive sciences. I do a lot of bouldering and running, love sleeping a full 8 hours, and binge-watch rock climbing youtube videos in my free time :)
