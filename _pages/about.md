# About Me 

I graduated from UMass Amherst in Spring 2023 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in philosophy, and I'm now a post-bacc researcher at the [Ã–lveczky Lab](https://olveczkylab.oeb.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. In my free time I enjoy running, hiking, bouldering, reading, and (try to) sleep a full 8 hours :)
