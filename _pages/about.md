I'm a final semester senior at UMass Amherst majoring in Computer Science. Will also graduate with a minor in philosophy and almost a minor in psychology after taking a lot of classes in those departments. Generally interested in anything related to the cognitive sciences. I like staying active (been getting into indoor boulderingâ€”typical!) and love sleeping a full 8 hours.
