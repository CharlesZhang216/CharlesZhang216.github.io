I graduatead from UMass Amherst with a major in Computer Science and a minor in philosophy. Current a SWE intern at Amazon. Generally interested in anything related to the cognitive sciences. I like staying active, love sleeping a full 8 hours, and binge rock climbing youtube videos in my free time :)
